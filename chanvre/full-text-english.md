To the Laudable Society for the Improvement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, this Treatise on Hemp, as both curious and useful, is with the greatest Respect inscribed by their most humble Servant, The Editor.

## Advertisement.

The Memoir on the preparations of Hemp, which M. Dodart, Intendant of Berry, published in 1755, for the use of that province,* excited the curiosity of the publick, with regard not only to the natural properties of that plant, but also to its origin and history.

Though this little work was intended solely for the instruction of manufacturers, some respectable persons, and particularly the Journalists of Trevoux, who were pleased to give a favourable account of it in the month of January, 1756, seemed to wish, that, on this occasion, we had collected all the interesting particulars, that History could furnish, of the use formerly made of Hemp, and the knowledge that the nations of remotest antiquity had of it. Others, more concerned about the improvement that may be made of it at this time, earnestly desired more circumstantial and particular accounts, not only with respect to the culture and methods of preparing this plant, but also with regard to the various uses that may be made of it, in several sorts of manufactures. Desirous to satisfy both, we have endeavoured to re-unite, in this Treatise, those researches and remarks, that seem to comprehend almost all that Hemp can present to the cluriosity of the learned, and the utility of the manufacturer: But far from flattering ourselves that we have exhausted a subject so interesting, and so extensive, with regard to which a great many experiments still remain to be made, we hope, that the first effect of this essay will be, to excite men of greater ability to take under further consideration, every thing that has relation to this valuable plant,* and its uses, which, perhaps, are as yet but very imperfectly known.

*) Bourges, the capital of Berry, (a province celebrated for its Hemp) was one of the cities of Gaul mentioned by Pliny, where, in his time, so great a quantity of linen and Hempen cloth was made, that he even seems to reproach them with... _Ita ne et Galliæ censentur hoc reditu? Montesque mari oppositos esse non est satis, et à latere Oceani obstare ipsum quod vocant inane Cadurci, Caleti, Ruteni, Bituriges, ultimique hominum existum uti morini, immo vero Galliæ universæ vela texunt._ Plin. l. 19. c. 1.

*) There is none that offers so great advantage to man; it even brings in more than corn. _Nouv. Mais. Rust. tom. 1. p. 680.

We shall give several extracts from different Authors, who have left us any notices of this plant, and its uses, either in Physick, or the Arts; we shall also give particular observations relating to economy, which is the principal design of this work, and add some remarks upon the bad practices, the frauds, the negligences, and abuses, that have creeped into this branch of commerce. In a word, we shall do every thing in our power to attain the end of this work: What further remains must be expected from the government, and from the publick.

## To the Lovers of the Arts.

The principal design of this Memoir being to carry to perfection those Arts, the knowledge and use of which are as extensive as they are necessary, we thought it no less proper to gain to our interest those who cultivate them, than those on whom they depend for protection. We therefore consecrate and dedicate this work to them; we submit our researches to the judgment of both; and if every thing we advance has not the happiness to please all, we hope, that that part of this Essay which they are pleased to approve of, will, at least, obtain their indulgence for that, which they may think deserves not their approbation.

# Part 1. Containing its History, with the Preparations and Uses made of it by the Ancients.

To pierce through the dark veil of remotest antiquity; to range, with our first parents, the fields and forests,* and from all the plants, which cover the face of the earth, to select those which seem to have been, at all times, the most useful and necessary; in a word, to discover the origin of Hemp, and shew how mankind, from the beginning, have employed it, is an enterprize the more difficult, that historians throw no light at all on this subject, and we can by no means find to whom we owe the discovery thereof, nor of its uses.

*) _Cannabis in silvis primum nata est._ Plin. l. 20. When the origin of an art is unknown, we must be content with conjecture and hypothesis instead of true history; and we may be assured, that, in such cases, the romance is more instructive than the truth. Generally speaking, chance suggests the first essays; they are fruitless, and never heard of: Another takes up the affair, he meets with some little success, but so little that it makes no noise: A third begins where the second left off: A fourth proceeds in the paths of the third; and so on, till the last of all produces some excellent experiments; and only these last discoveries make a sensible impression. If we have this discovery from a stranger, national jealousy conceals the name of the inventor, and it remains unknown. The origin and progress of an art are not like those of a science; learned men communicate their thoughts to one another; they write, they make the most of their discoveries, they contradict, and are contradicted; these disputes are proofs of facts, and ascertain their dates. Artists, on the contrary, live in obscurity, and in a kind of solitude; they do all with a view to profit, and scarce any thing for fame or glory. Some inventions continue whole ages, confined to one family: they are handed down from fathers to their children, and carried to perfection or suffered to decay; so that we know not precisely to what person, or to what time, we ought to ascribe their discovery. The insensible steps by which arts rise to perfection, contribute also to render their dates uncertain. _One pulls the hemp, another waters it, a third peels it; it is at first a coarse twine, then a thread, and afterwards woven into cloth; but a whole age intervenes between every step of this progress._ Could one man carry a production from its natural state to the highest degree of improvement, it would be a very difficult matter to conceal his name. Should a people all at once find themselves cloathed with a new kind of stuff, how could they avoid enquiring to whom they owed the discovery? But such cases never, or very rarely happen. _Encycl. vol. 5. p._ 647.

It is to be presumed, that this plant having been cultivated, and applied to use, long before histories were written, the first writers did not think it necessary to speak of what was perfectly well known already, and at the same time very common.

I suppose, therefore, that chance or necessity, the two great springs of invention, at first discovered to men a plant as common as it is valuable. The first who made use of it wanted only, perhaps, a withe to tie up a branch, or a girdle for his waiste. He found, in Hemp, flexibility, limberness, and strength. Upon this, he took particular notice of the plant, and observed its distinguishing marks. This was enough to make him communicate it to his family and his neighbours; every one was sensible of the utility of this production for all sorts of ligatures. They would, no doubt, be disposed to multiply and render more common a plant, which appeared so very necessary: It was accordingly cultivated; but several ages, perhaps, elapsed, before any one thought of separating the bark from the stem. It was, however, at last found out, that by this means its use might be rendered more considerable and more extensive. It will be easily believed, that the preparation of Hemp, by _watering_ it, was not at first performed so exactly as at present. They began, without doubt, with twisting it into small ropes,* as the shepherds in the country still continue to do. Hereafter some set up rope-yards; others, probably, attempted to spin it, then made it into cloth*; but what sort of cloth must this have been? At last, as by degrees, arts, as well as men, are brought to perfection; after several thousands of years, Hemp came to be made into fine cloth; and none but persons of great experience could distinguish it from what was at that time made of Flax.

*) History informs us, that the weaver's looms, in ancient times, were of a frame very different from those we use at this day. The operators did not fit, but worked standing; and when they were employed on webs that were to be flowered on both sides, they turned round their looms.  _Arguto tenues percurrens pectine Telas._ Æneid. 7.  Homer, Herodotus, Theophylact, _etc._ acquaint us, that the warp of their hempen cloth was extended from top to bottom of the loom, and that, in applying the woof, which they struck home with a kind of wooden sword, they worked almost in the same manner with those that weave girths with us.

Herodotus, the most ancient historian, acquaints us, in the fourth book of his history, "That, in his time, the people of Thrace cultivated a kind of Hemp, [GREEK], that very much resembled flax, excepting that the stalk of it rose higher. Some of it, says he, is cultivated, and another kind grows wild: Both these kinds are preferable to every thing of the sort that we have in Greece. The Thracians* make cloths of it, which are as beautiful to the eye, as those that are made of flax; and none can perceive the difference, but such as are perfectly acquainted with such manufactures."

*) The Thracians, as we are told by Herodotus, _l._ 5. were, next to the Indians, the most extensive of all nations: They derived their original and name from Teras, the son of Japheth, who was their Patriarch. In old times under this name were comprehended, not only the inhabitants of Thrace, but also the _Getæ, the _Daci_, and the _Mysians_: The names of _Thrace_ and _Scythia_ are also sometimes taken indifferently for one another.  
_Nascitur autem apud cos (Scythas) Cannabis, Lino simillima, præter quam crassitudine et magnitudine, sed multo quan nostra præstantior, vel sua sponte nascens, vel sata, ex qua Thraces vestimenta conficiunt Lineis simillima; quæ nisi quis fit valde exercitatus, Linea sint, an Cannabea, non queat dignoscere, et qui non viderit Cannabem existimet Lineum esse vestimentum._ Herodot. Melp. pag. 281. edit. Græc. Lat. Henrici Stephani, ann. 1592.

If it is plain, from this passage, that, a long time before the christian æra, Hemp was cultivated in Thrace, as well as in Greece,* and at that time made into fine cloth; may we not conjecture, that other neighbouring nations, with whom they had any correspondence, understood the use of it also. Can it be supposed, that the Chaldæans, the Babylonians, the Persians, and the Egyptians did not make use of it, at least for ropes,* which is the first use to which it would naturally be applied? Is it to be presumed, that those famous buildings so much boasted of in antiquity, without excepting that stately tower, which was the first monument of the wickedness and industry of men, were carried to perfection without the help of ropes? Though the holy Scripture mentions only Flax, on all occasions relating to Hemp, or linen cloth, or garments made of these materials, and the Hebrew text has taken no notice of Hemp, under the name we give it, in imitation of the Greeks and Latins, this is no sufficient reason for believing that the Jews were altogether unacquainted with the use and properties of this plant. The term [GREEK],* or _linum_, which is used by the Greek and Latin translators; ought to be considered as one of those general expressions that were much used in the Hebrew* and Chaldaic languages.

*) The Hemp which was cultivated in Greece, was not so good as that of Thrace, but it made excellent ropes, as we shall see hereafter, and, without doubt, coarse cloth for sails, and other works of this sort.

*) _Demisit ergo eos per funem de fenestra._ Joshua chap. 2. ver. 15. This rope is in the translation called [GREEK].

*) The term _linum_ and [GREEK] was used to express all sorts of materials proper for the construction of cloth and ropes, as we are told by Robert Stephens, in his dictionary of the Latin tongue; where he says, that [GREEK] is [GREEK], _antiquo Verbo, quod est teneo, quia Lino omnia tenentur_. On this subject he quotes several authors, who give this word nine or ten different significations.  
Linum pro Filo. _Cels. l._ 7. c. 14.  
Pro Fune Nautico. _Ovid._ 3. _Fast._  
Pro Verriculo. _Virg._ 1. _Georg._  
Pro Vinculo. _Id._ v. _Ænæid._  
Pro Velo Navis. _Homer. Iliad._  
Pro Linteo in quo dormitur. _Id._  
Pro Hamo Piscatorum. _Id._  
Pro Fidibus Nervorum. _Id._  
Pro Cassibus quibus feræ capiuntur. _Ovid._ 3. _Met._  
Hence _Lino Sparton_, not that sort of which sheets or sails were made, but a coarser sort of Flax, or Hemp, which was made into ropes.  
The word _linteum_, for the same reason, was used to signify all those sorts of cloth, _quæ ex cortice Lini, Cannabis, aut Byssi, texebantur_. We shall see hereafter, that the word _Spartum_ was of the same kind. _Veteribus Græcis [GREEK] dicebatur, id omne ex quo fierent vitilia, aut funes, aliaque ad nexum idonea, ut sunt Linum, Cannabis, Junci, Genistæ, etc._ Vossius, Diction. Etymol.

*) The Hebrews, for instance, used the word _Baal_, to signify all sorts of gods or goddesses.

The Greeks, indeed, made use of a kind of broom, _Spartum_, [GREEK],* which they brought from Spain, for the service of their marine, and for caulking their ships, because it made greater resistance to the water than Hemp; but for ropes and every other purpose they preferred Hemp. Is it possible that Nineveh, Babylon, Memphis, Palmira, Thebes, and so many other famous cities should have been quite unacquainted with the use of a plant so necessary and so common?

*) _In Græcia Sparti copia modo cœpit esse ex Hispania, neque ea ipsa facultate usi Liburni, sed hi plerumque naves loris suebant. Græci magis Cannabo et stupâ, cæterisque Sativis rebus à quibus [GREEK], Sparta appellabant._ Aul. Gel. l. 17. c. 3.  
_In sicco præferunt è Cannabe funes._ Plin. l. 19. c. 2.  
This _Spartum_, [GREEK], has occasioned great difficulties among learned men. The Greek authors, and their Commentators, speak so differently of it, that it is still very doubtful in what sense it ought to be taken. Some pretend that its name is derived from _satum_, id est, _sativum_; while Pliny maintains that the _spartum_ of Spain _sponte nasci, nec seri posse_. Others will have it to come from [GREEK], _nectere et complicare_ (_Hesychius, Suidas, Aristophanes, Pollux, vocant [GREEK] vel [GREEK] funes vel funiculos quibus utebantur fabri ad varios usus, sive ex Lino, Cannabe, Junco, vel alia materia nexi fuerint, aut conserti._ Henr. Steph.), because the Greeks gave this name to every thing that could bear to be spun and twisted: This is the opinion of the best authors. They use the word _Spartum_, to express every thing that is of the nature of Hemp, as the Hebrews did the word Flax to signify three sorts of things, which are often confounded in the Holy Scripture, _viz. Bad, Linum_, the most common sort, which was used in the making of cordage and coarse cloth; _Schesch, Gossipium_, a finer sort, sometimes taken for cotton, which was used in making cloaths for persons of rank and distinction; _Buz, Byssus_, very fine, which served for making making ornaments for an use of the Priests and the Temple; it is scarce possible to imagine, that the Jews were entirely unacquainted with Hemp, which was so well known to other nations (_Est enim verò Eleorum ager, et cætera ferax, et Byssum educat felicissime. Cannabem quidem Linum et Byssum serunt, qui idoneum ad hæc serenda solum colunt._ Pausan. lib. 6. ad finem.). It is much more natural to suppose, that it was one of these kinds of Flax we meet with in the several texts of Scripture, where mention is made of coarse, and fine linen, and of cordage. See Ezek. ch. 27. ver. 16; 1 Chron. ch. 6. ver. 21; ch. 15. ver. 27; and 2 Chron. ch. 2. ver. 14; ch. 3. ver. 14; Esth. ch. 1. ver. 6; ch. 8. ver. 15.

The Romans made sails of it, and ropes for their sea* and land service. They had magazines of it in two of the principal cities of the western Empire; the Hemp necessary for the purposes of war, was, by the Emperor's | orders, amassed at Ravenna in Italy, and Vienna in Gaul. The officer, who superintended that matter on the further side of the Alps, was called the Procurator of the Hemp manufactures in Gaul, and had his residence at Vienna. Their husbandmen used Hemp for tying the oxen to the yokes*; and, without doubt, for all the other purposes relating to agriculture. We know that they made no great use of linen cloth, but they had some; and Vigenerus, upon Titus Livius, tells us, that they made use of Hemp: Even their laws and their annals were written on hempen cloth.* Nothing is more generally or better known than the use they made of it for adorning their theatres, covering their streets and their publick places, their amphitheatres, and their _arenæ_ for the Gladiators, to shade those who assisted at their publick shews. Plin. l. 19. c. 1.

*) _Cannabinisque funibus cornua jumentorum ligato._ Columel. lib. 16. cap. 2.

*) _Licinius Macer auctor est et in fœdere Ardeatino, et in Linteis Libris ad Monetæ inventa... quæ si in ea re sit error, quod tam veteres Annales, quodque Magistratum Libri quos Linteos in æde repositos Monetæ, Macer Linius, citat identidem Auctores._ Tit. Liv. l. 4. c. 7. et 20.  It was in the temple of Moneta that the books of Hempen cloth, containing the destiny and fates of the Roman Empire, were kept with great care.  
The Samnites also made use of the same cloth for the purpose of writing. Tit. Liv. l. 10.
