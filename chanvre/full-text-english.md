To the Laudable Society for the Improvement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, this Treatise on Hemp, as both curious and useful, is with the greatest Respect inscribed by their most humble Servant, The Editor.

## Advertisement.

The Memoir on the preparations of Hemp, which M. Dodart, Intendant of Berry, published in 1755, for the use of that province,* excited the curiosity of the publick, with regard not only to the natural properties of that plant, but also to its origin and history.

Though this little work was intended solely for the instruction of manufacturers, some respectable persons, and particularly the Journalists of Trevoux, who were pleased to give a favourable account of it in the month of January, 1756, seemed to wish, that, on this occasion, we had collected all the interesting particulars, that History could furnish, of the use formerly made of Hemp, and the knowledge that the nations of remotest antiquity had of it. Others, more concerned about the improvement that may be made of it at this time, earnestly desired more circumstantial and particular accounts, not only with respect to the culture and methods of preparing this plant, but also with regard to the various uses that may be made of it, in several sorts of manufactures. Desirous to satisfy both, we have endeavoured to re-unite, in this Treatise, those researches and remarks, that seem to comprehend almost all that Hemp can present to the cluriosity of the learned, and the utility of the manufacturer: But far from flattering ourselves that we have exhausted a subject so interesting, and so extensive, with regard to which a great many experiments still remain to be made, we hope, that the first effect of this essay will be, to excite men of greater ability to take under further consideration, every thing that has relation to this valuable plant,* and its uses, which, perhaps, are as yet but very imperfectly known.

*) Bourges, the capital of Berry, (a province celebrated for its Hemp) was one of the cities of Gaul mentioned by Pliny, where, in his time, so great a quantity of linen and Hempen cloth was made, that he even seems to reproach them with... _Ita ne et Galliæ censentur hoc reditu? Montesque mari oppositos esse non est satis, et à latere Oceani obstare ipsum quod vocant inane Cadurci, Caleti, Ruteni, Bituriges, ultimique hominum existum uti morini, immo vero Galliæ universæ vela texunt._ Plin. l. 19. c. 1.

*) There is none that offers so great advantage to man; it even brings in more than corn. _Nouv. Mais. Rust. tom. 1. p. 680.

We shall give several extracts from different Authors, who have left us any notices of this plant, and its uses, either in Physick, or the Arts; we shall also give particular observations relating to economy, which is the principal design of this work, and add some remarks upon the bad practices, the frauds, the negligences, and abuses, that have creeped into this branch of commerce. In a word, we shall do every thing in our power to attain the end of this work: What further remains must be expected from the government, and from the publick.

## To the Lovers of the Arts.

The principal design of this Memoir being to carry to perfection those Arts, the knowledge and use of which are as extensive as they are necessary, we thought it no less proper to gain to our interest those who cultivate them, than those on whom they depend for protection. We therefore consecrate and dedicate this work to them; we submit our researches to the judgment of both; and if every thing we advance has not the happiness to please all, we hope, that that part of this Essay which they are pleased to approve of, will, at least, obtain their indulgence for that, which they may think deserves not their approbation.

# Part 1. Containing its History, with the Preparations and Uses made of it by the Ancients.

To pierce through the dark veil of remotest antiquity; to range, with our first parents, the fields and forests,* and from all the plants, which cover the face of the earth, to select those which seem to have been, at all times, the most useful and necessary; in a word, to discover the origin of Hemp, and shew how mankind, from the beginning, have employed it, is an enterprize the more difficult, that historians throw no light at all on this subject, and we can by no means find to whom we owe the discovery thereof, nor of its uses.

*) _Cannabis in silvis primum nata est._ Plin. l. 20. When the origin of an art is unknown, we must be content with conjecture and hypothesis instead of true history; and we may be assured, that, in such cases, the romance is more instructive than the truth. Generally speaking, chance suggests the first essays; they are fruitless, and never heard of: Another takes up the affair, he meets with some little success, but so little that it makes no noise: A third begins where the second left off: A fourth proceeds in the paths of the third; and so on, till the last of all produces some excellent experiments; and only these last discoveries make a sensible impression. If we have this discovery from a stranger, national jealousy conceals the name of the inventor, and it remains unknown. The origin and progress of an art are not like those of a science; learned men communicate their thoughts to one another; they write, they make the most of their discoveries, they contradict, and are contradicted; these disputes are proofs of facts, and ascertain their dates. Artists, on the contrary, live in obscurity, and in a kind of solitude; they do all with a view to profit, and scarce any thing for fame or glory. Some inventions continue whole ages, confined to one family: they are handed down from fathers to their children, and carried to perfection or suffered to decay; so that we know not precisely to what person, or to what time, we ought to ascribe their discovery. The insensible steps by which arts rise to perfection, contribute also to render their dates uncertain. _One pulls the hemp, another waters it, a third peels it; it is at first a coarse twine, then a thread, and afterwards woven into cloth; but a whole age intervenes between every step of this progress._ Could one man carry a production from its natural state to the highest degree of improvement, it would be a very difficult matter to conceal his name. Should a people all at once find themselves cloathed with a new kind of stuff, how could they avoid enquiring to whom they owed the discovery? But such cases never, or very rarely happen. _Encycl. vol. 5. p._ 647.

It is to be presumed, that this plant having been cultivated, and applied to use, long before histories were written, the first writers did not think it necessary to speak of what was perfectly well known already, and at the same time very common.

I suppose, therefore, that chance or necessity, the two great springs of invention, at first discovered to men a plant as common as it is valuable. The first who made use of it wanted only, perhaps, a withe to tie up a branch, or a girdle for his waiste. He found, in Hemp, flexibility, limberness, and strength. Upon this, he took particular notice of the plant, and observed its distinguishing marks. This was enough to make him communicate it to his family and his neighbours; every one was sensible of the utility of this production for all sorts of ligatures. They would, no doubt, be disposed to multiply and render more common a plant, which appeared so very necessary: It was accordingly cultivated; but several ages, perhaps, elapsed, before any one thought of separating the bark from the stem. It was, however, at last found out, that by this means its use might be rendered more considerable and more extensive. It will be easily believed, that the preparation of Hemp, by _watering_ it, was not at first performed so exactly as at present. They began, without doubt, with twisting it into small ropes,* as the shepherds in the country still continue to do. Hereafter some set up rope-yards; others, probably, attempted to spin it, then made it into cloth*; but what sort of cloth must this have been? At last, as by degrees, arts, as well as men, are brought to perfection; after several thousands of years, Hemp came to be made into fine cloth; and none but persons of great experience could distinguish it from what was at that time made of Flax.

*) _Cannabis sativa planta, magni usus in vitâ, ad robustissimos funes factitandos._ Dioscor. l. 3. c. 141.  _Utilissima funibus Cannabis._ Plin. l. 19. c. 9.

*) History informs us, that the weaver's looms, in ancient times, were of a frame very different from those we use at this day. The operators did not fit, but worked standing; and when they were employed on webs that were to be flowered on both sides, they turned round their looms.  _Arguto tenues percurrens pectine Telas._ Æneid. 7.  Homer, Herodotus, Theophylact, _etc._ acquaint us, that the warp of their hempen cloth was extended from top to bottom of the loom, and that, in applying the woof, which they struck home with a kind of wooden sword, they worked almost in the same manner with those that weave girths with us.

Herodotus, the most ancient historian, acquaints us, in the fourth book of his history, "That, in his time, the people of Thrace cultivated a kind of Hemp, [GREEK], that very much resembled flax, excepting that the stalk of it rose higher. Some of it, says he, is cultivated, and another kind grows wild: Both these kinds are preferable to every thing of the sort that we have in Greece. The Thracians* make cloths of it, which are as beautiful to the eye, as those that are made of flax; and none can perceive the difference, but such as are perfectly acquainted with such manufactures."

*) The Thracians, as we are told by Herodotus, _l._ 5. were, next to the Indians, the most extensive of all nations: They derived their original and name from Teras, the son of Japheth, who was their Patriarch. In old times under this name were comprehended, not only the inhabitants of Thrace, but also the _Getæ, the _Daci_, and the _Mysians_: The names of _Thrace_ and _Scythia_ are also sometimes taken indifferently for one another.  
_Nascitur autem apud cos (Scythas) Cannabis, Lino simillima, præter quam crassitudine et magnitudine, sed multo quan nostra præstantior, vel sua sponte nascens, vel sata, ex qua Thraces vestimenta conficiunt Lineis simillima; quæ nisi quis fit valde exercitatus, Linea sint, an Cannabea, non queat dignoscere, et qui non viderit Cannabem existimet Lineum esse vestimentum._ Herodot. Melp. pag. 281. edit. Græc. Lat. Henrici Stephani, ann. 1592.

If it is plain, from this passage, that, a long time before the christian æra, Hemp was cultivated in Thrace, as well as in Greece,* and at that time made into fine cloth; may we not conjecture, that other neighbouring nations, with whom they had any correspondence, understood the use of it also. Can it be supposed, that the Chaldæans, the Babylonians, the Persians, and the Egyptians did not make use of it, at least for ropes,* which is the first use to which it would naturally be applied? Is it to be presumed, that those famous buildings so much boasted of in antiquity, without excepting that stately tower, which was the first monument of the wickedness and industry of men, were carried to perfection without the help of ropes? Though the holy Scripture mentions only Flax, on all occasions relating to Hemp, or linen cloth, or garments made of these materials, and the Hebrew text has taken no notice of Hemp, under the name we give it, in imitation of the Greeks and Latins, this is no sufficient reason for believing that the Jews were altogether unacquainted with the use and properties of this plant. The term [GREEK],* or _linum_, which is used by the Greek and Latin translators; ought to be considered as one of those general expressions that were much used in the Hebrew* and Chaldaic languages.

*) The Hemp which was cultivated in Greece, was not so good as that of Thrace, but it made excellent ropes, as we shall see hereafter, and, without doubt, coarse cloth for sails, and other works of this sort.

*) _Demisit ergo eos per funem de fenestra._ Joshua chap. 2. ver. 15. This rope is in the translation called [GREEK].

*) The term _linum_ and [GREEK] was used to express all sorts of materials proper for the construction of cloth and ropes, as we are told by Robert Stephens, in his dictionary of the Latin tongue; where he says, that [GREEK] is [GREEK], _antiquo Verbo, quod est teneo, quia Lino omnia tenentur_. On this subject he quotes several authors, who give this word nine or ten different significations.  
Linum pro Filo. _Cels. l._ 7. c. 14.  
Pro Fune Nautico. _Ovid._ 3. _Fast._  
Pro Verriculo. _Virg._ 1. _Georg._  
Pro Vinculo. _Id._ v. _Ænæid._  
Pro Velo Navis. _Homer. Iliad._  
Pro Linteo in quo dormitur. _Id._  
Pro Hamo Piscatorum. _Id._  
Pro Fidibus Nervorum. _Id._  
Pro Cassibus quibus feræ capiuntur. _Ovid._ 3. _Met._  
Hence _Lino Sparton_, not that sort of which sheets or sails were made, but a coarser sort of Flax, or Hemp, which was made into ropes.  
The word _linteum_, for the same reason, was used to signify all those sorts of cloth, _quæ ex cortice Lini, Cannabis, aut Byssi, texebantur_. We shall see hereafter, that the word _Spartum_ was of the same kind. _Veteribus Græcis [GREEK] dicebatur, id omne ex quo fierent vitilia, aut funes, aliaque ad nexum idonea, ut sunt Linum, Cannabis, Junci, Genistæ, etc._ Vossius, Diction. Etymol.

*) The Hebrews, for instance, used the word _Baal_, to signify all sorts of gods or goddesses.

The Greeks, indeed, made use of a kind of broom, _Spartum_, [GREEK],* which they brought from Spain, for the service of their marine, and for caulking their ships, because it made greater resistance to the water than Hemp; but for ropes and every other purpose they preferred Hemp. Is it possible that Nineveh, Babylon, Memphis, Palmira, Thebes, and so many other famous cities should have been quite unacquainted with the use of a plant so necessary and so common?

*) _In Græcia Sparti copia modo cœpit esse ex Hispania, neque ea ipsa facultate usi Liburni, sed hi plerumque naves loris suebant. Græci magis Cannabo et stupâ, cæterisque Sativis rebus à quibus [GREEK], Sparta appellabant._ Aul. Gel. l. 17. c. 3.  
_In sicco præferunt è Cannabe funes._ Plin. l. 19. c. 2.  
This _Spartum_, [GREEK], has occasioned great difficulties among learned men. The Greek authors, and their Commentators, speak so differently of it, that it is still very doubtful in what sense it ought to be taken. Some pretend that its name is derived from _satum_, id est, _sativum_; while Pliny maintains that the _spartum_ of Spain _sponte nasci, nec seri posse_. Others will have it to come from [GREEK], _nectere et complicare_ (_Hesychius, Suidas, Aristophanes, Pollux, vocant [GREEK] vel [GREEK] funes vel funiculos quibus utebantur fabri ad varios usus, sive ex Lino, Cannabe, Junco, vel alia materia nexi fuerint, aut conserti._ Henr. Steph.), because the Greeks gave this name to every thing that could bear to be spun and twisted: This is the opinion of the best authors. They use the word _Spartum_, to express every thing that is of the nature of Hemp, as the Hebrews did the word Flax to signify three sorts of things, which are often confounded in the Holy Scripture, _viz. Bad, Linum_, the most common sort, which was used in the making of cordage and coarse cloth; _Schesch, Gossipium_, a finer sort, sometimes taken for cotton, which was used in making cloaths for persons of rank and distinction; _Buz, Byssus_, very fine, which served for making making ornaments for an use of the Priests and the Temple; it is scarce possible to imagine, that the Jews were entirely unacquainted with Hemp, which was so well known to other nations (_Est enim verò Eleorum ager, et cætera ferax, et Byssum educat felicissime. Cannabem quidem Linum et Byssum serunt, qui idoneum ad hæc serenda solum colunt._ Pausan. lib. 6. ad finem.). It is much more natural to suppose, that it was one of these kinds of Flax we meet with in the several texts of Scripture, where mention is made of coarse, and fine linen, and of cordage. See Ezek. ch. 27. ver. 16; 1 Chron. ch. 6. ver. 21; ch. 15. ver. 27; and 2 Chron. ch. 2. ver. 14; ch. 3. ver. 14; Esth. ch. 1. ver. 6; ch. 8. ver. 15.

The Romans made sails of it, and ropes for their sea* and land service. They had magazines of it in two of the principal cities of the western Empire; the Hemp necessary for the purposes of war, was, by the Emperor's | orders, amassed at Ravenna in Italy, and Vienna in Gaul. The officer, who superintended that matter on the further side of the Alps, was called the Procurator of the Hemp manufactures in Gaul, and had his residence at Vienna. Their husbandmen used Hemp for tying the oxen to the yokes*; and, without doubt, for all the other purposes relating to agriculture. We know that they made no great use of linen cloth, but they had some; and Vigenerus, upon Titus Livius, tells us, that they made use of Hemp: Even their laws and their annals were written on hempen cloth.* Nothing is more generally or better known than the use they made of it for adorning their theatres, covering their streets and their publick places, their amphitheatres, and their _arenæ_ for the Gladiators, to shade those who assisted at their publick shews. Plin. l. 19. c. 1.

*) _Licinius Macer auctor est et in fœdere Ardeatino, et in Linteis Libris ad Monetæ inventa... quæ si in ea re sit error, quod tam veteres Annales, quodque Magistratum Libri quos Linteos in æde repositos Monetæ, Macer Linius, citat identidem Auctores._ Tit. Liv. l. 4. c. 7. et 20.  It was in the temple of Moneta that the books of Hempen cloth, containing the destiny and fates of the Roman Empire, were kept with great care.  
The Samnites also made use of the same cloth for the purpose of writing. Tit. Liv. l. 10.

Martial informs us, that the Romans also made use of hempen cloth for table linen, and that every guest generally brought his napkin with him.* We cannot therefore in the least doubt, but Hemp was known to the ancients,* as a material of cloth for the service of war, both by sea and land,* as well as for the purposes of agriculture. And if the greatest part of authors have sometimes made use of the word _Spartum_,* to signify ropes; even when those ropes were made of Hemp, the reason was, because they considered _Spartum_ as a general term applicable to Hemp as well Flax, or any material of that kind*; unless the signification of it be otherwise absolutely determined. In a word, how much should we know of the use that was formerly made of Hemp in China and Japan, and so in both hemispheres, if their histories had come with more accuracy into our hands.

Exercit. Plin. pag. 261... and he adds: _...ex Lino Hispanico, quis putet rudentes navium tortos unquam fuisse? Nugatur itaque Solinus, nec enim ad id dixit Mela. Ex Lino tamen armamenta navium etiam olim fuisse, eruditioribus placuisse, ibidem notat Plinius, qui versum Homori ita interpretabantur, quoniam cum sparta dixit significaverit sata. Quæ non intelligo, quasi necesse sit [GREEK], nomine Linum accipi, quia significaverit sata. An non et Cannabis sativa, de qua [GREEK], id est sata, in illo Homeri loco possumus interpretari... Nugatur itaque Solinus, nisi dicamus eum sub materie rudentum, Spartum tantum comprehendisse._  The _Spartum_ of Spain, which we interpret _broom_, is a sort of rush, _Juncum aridi foli_, that grows near Carthagena; it is prepared almost in the same manner with Hemp by _watering_; it naturally grows in that soil, and cannot be raised from seed.  
The Greeks also made use of another kind of rush for making ropes, which from thence had the name of [GREEK].

We read in Kolben, that the Hottentots use a plant, named _Dakka_, instead of tobacco, or at least mix them together, when their provision of the latter is almost exhausted. This herb, says he, is a kind of wild Hemp, which the Europeans sow principally for the use of the Hottentots.*

Though the etymology of the word Hemp does not appear to be a matter of great importance, we think it our duty not to omit it, that we may leave nothing untouched that can be proposed with regard to this plant. Some pretend that it comes from the Celtic word _Canab_*; others think they find its root in the Greek word [GREEK], or [GREEK],* which comes from the Hebrew _Kannab_; in Latin _Canna_; in French _Canne_; because its form, and the length and size of its stalk give occasion to compare it to a cane. And therefore, as we say, a sugar-cane, _etc._ we may also say, a hemp-cane. The terminations of particular languages, such as [GREEK] or [GREEK], in Greek; _Cannabis_ or _Cannabum_ in Latin; _Canapo_ in Italian; _Canamo_ in Spanish, _etc._ are so many expressions peculiar to those languages, but that variety makes no alteration in the signification.

*) Pezron. _Cannabis, Græcè [GREEK], vel [GREEK], unde et Belgicum_ Kennep, _quasi_ Kannab, _herba est funibus faciendis idonea, à Lino, et tenuitate, et candore distans. Est verò [GREEK]._

*) Vossius.

Hemp is commonly distinguished into two sorts; one that grows wild, _Cannabis silvestris_; the other produced by cultivation, _Cannabis domestica_. This latter is of two sexes; the male _fructifera_, and the female _florifera_; but both improperly so called, for it is more natural to call that the _female_, which bears the fruit, than the other that bears the flower. The seed and the root of wild Hemp, are like those of the wild mallow; the stalks are smaller, blacker, more rough, and about a foot and half in height; the leaves are like those of Hemp raised by cultivation, but more rough, and likewise blacker.*

*) _Nigriore folio et asperior._ Plin. l. 20. c. 23.

The root of Hemp produced by cultivation is six inches long, or thereabout, of a whitish colour, ligneous, undivided, and running to a point, having fibres only on two lines, diametrically opposite to one another, when it is not straitened for want of room; and thick in proportion to the stalk it bears. The stalk is round, from the root to the first ramification; it then assumes a quadrangular form, and is fluted, hollow, ligneous, covered with a greenish bark, composed of filaments, hairy and rough to the touch: at proper distances this bark is secured from place to place by six small fastenings, which keep it close to the stem, like so many little nails, regularly ranged on the circumference of the same circle, and almost equally distant from one another. Its length and thickness are various, according to the difference of the soil, of the method of cultivation, of the climate, and of the seasons. Some of it rises to the heighth of eight or ten feet, and the stalks look like so many little trees*; others seem to pine away on the ground, and scarce get to the height of two or three feet, sometimes less. A grain of Hemp-seed, sown by itself, in a soil that agrees with it, commonly produces a stalk very large* and firm, with many branches, and looks like a little tree. If it is of that sex which produces seed, it will yield a great many grains, and those very beautiful: But its bark being too hard and thick, will not be very fit for manufacturing: On the contrary, seed sown in a field, that is properly prepared for the purpose, and near to each other, produce stalks that are streight, smooth, without branches, softer,* and more tender than the former; and the bark of such being smooth, fine, and soft, is much valued for several uses. The leaves grow two and two opposite to one another; they are divided into many segments, being narrow, oblong, sharp pointed, jagged, full of veins, of a deep green colour, rough to the touch, and of a strong smell, that affects the head.

*) _Quod ad proceritatem attinet, Rosea agri Sabini arborum altitudinem æquat._ Plin. l. 29. c. 9.

*) Of such stalks they make a kind of charcoal, fit to enter into the composition of gunpowder.

*) _Quo densior eo tenuior._ Plin. l. 19. c. 9.

The flowers that grow on the female stalk, as it is commonly called, issue from the _alæ_ of the leaves, on a pedicle of four little clusters, lying in the form of a Saint Andrew's cross: They have no _petals_, and consist of five stamina, with yellowish summits, in a calyx of five leaves, of a purple colour without, and whitish on the inside; these flowers are not followed by any fruit; and, on the other hand, the fruit on the stalks that produce it, is never preceded by any flower.

Whatever the order of nature may be in the vegetation of this plant, both the male and the female stalks are produced indiscriminately from the grains of seed that grow on the same stalk; and the difference cannot be known till they come to blossom. We know not, when we sow Hemp, what quantity of either sex will be produced, nor which contributes most to the propagation of the plant; they cannot, however, be easily distinguished till* sixty days after they are sown; but this observation, hitherto, does not appear to have been of any consequence.

*) The time when the Hemp blossoms cannot be exactly ascertained; for it depends on several circumstances. Sometimes it is not above a foot high; when this is the case, the Hemp continues weak, and grows little or nothing at all higher; this is sometimes occasioned by great heats, or other unfavourable accidents; at other times it rises to the heighth of four or five feet before it blossoms, and grows almost as much after. The Hemp, which bears the flower, commonly gets before that which produces the seed, and rises about half a foot above that which bears the grain. This superiority, in the order of nature, may be well accounted for, if it is true, that the powder, which issues from the flower, serves to convey fertility to the grain on the stalks that bear the seed.

The fruit grows in a great number of bunches at the end of the stalks and branches, which naturally produce them: This fruit is terminated by a forked style, when it is in _embryo_, and is wrapt in a membrane, which secures it till it comes to maturity; then the pistillum changing to a roundish grain, forces the membranous capsulæ, which contain it, to open, and we therein discover a round smooth grain, somewhat flattened, and of a shining grey colour, containing, under a thin shell, a tender, sweet, and oily, white kernel, of a strong smell, that intoxicates when it is fresh. This kernel is covered with a green pellicle, terminating in a point on the side next the germ, which is very singularly situated.

This grain, which is called _Hemp-seed_, is no less useful for its peculiar qualities, than for those which it has in common with the whole plant. Its substance, considered as a seed, is soft, fat, oily, and gummy; it ferments, conceives heat, and springs up with equal facility; its pores being large, tender, and flexible, receive greedily the impressions of heat and humidity, which transmit to them the nutricious juices supplied by a fat, light, and well-laboured soil; its fibres, after a quick germination, unfold themselves, grow up, and attain strength, and the gum, being the principle of their union, supports and preserves them. Besides the use of its oil in Physick, it is also employed, with great advantage, in the lamp, and in coarse painting: They give a paste made of it to hogs and horses, to fatten them; it enters into the composition of black soap, the use of which is very common in the manufactures of stuffs and felts; and it is also used for tanning nets.

A grain of Hemp-seed, seen by the help of a microscope, presents at first a greyish epidermis, full of veins, the compartments whereof appear like a sort of scales. Under this first cover you see a brown olive coloured bark, extremely smooth on the inside, formed of two shells, which separate exactly in the middle, like those of a nut, the seam that joins them being quite imperceptible. Under a green cover, its kernel, in the form of a little orange, bears its germ produced along one of its sides, which makes it look a little flatted: When you have taken up this pellicle, you find a white kind of matter, consisting of two lobes joined together, which evidently form a kind of head; these lobes are very distinct, and by the germination are made to swell, open, and separate. Its germ, which is roundish, bending back along the whole external length of the grain, under the seam which joins the two shells, terminates in a point, and forms a kind of tendril, which is the only part that pierces the ground to form the root; the other end of the germ, which lies concealed between the two lobes that enclose and preserve it, appears like an exceeding fine and delicate sort of lance*; from it issue the two leaves that appear first, and we may imagine it to be the true principle of its germination and life. These two lobes are also changed into two sorts of thick green leaves,* of an oval form, but not indented, which serve for a rampart, and preservative to the springing leaves. The whole of this white matter seems to be fat and spongious; and its pores appear to be no less open than those of snow: And it is, no doubt, owing to the situation of its germ, and the softness of its whole substance, that Hemp-seed, beyond any other sort of grain, has so great a disposition to ferment, and spring up almost as soon as it is sown.

*) Which they call _the feather_.

*) Which the Botanists call _the seminal leaves_.

The bark, as it appears upon the stalk, forms a green, knotty, rough or prickly covering to it. These knots and prickles are mere excrescences of gum, of which the whole bark is composed; but they have different degrees of force and adhesion. This first superficial gum serves only to keep the fibres of the Hemp close together, and as a kind of mastick to cover, strengthen, and protect them, against the inclemency of the air, the dust, and the rain: It dissolves, exfoliates, and breaks, when the bark is watered.

The inside of the bark, which touches the stem, is smooth, soft, and white; the fibres are very distinct from one another, and appear perfectly in all their dimensions, by means of the watering just mentioned. It was not observed in former times, that the thread had its existence in the plant, without any dependence on the operations of art; that the labour is confined to cleaning, dividing, and separating the soft fibres of which the bark is composed; and that this bark is a kind of natural ribbon, or scarf, the threads whereof are applied and joined together, lengthways, only, by a dirty glutinous humour, which must absolutely be dissolved and separated, because it is equally hurtful to the workmen and the work. The threads themselves also consist merely of a gum, but of one that is of a different quality from the superficial gum; they are supple, strong, and resist the impressions to which the former give way. Every fibre is composed of gummy globules, that are very fine, transparent, and bright, when sufficiently cleared from that superficial gum that surrounds them; and which the microscope shews to be of a different sort. All this will appear plain, if you take a few fibres from a thread that is thoroughly bleached. The fibres of Hemp, in this state, are nothing different from those of cotton and silk, which makes it reasonable to consider them as materials of the same kind: And it is a convincing proof of this, that when they are mixed and carded together, there appears to be a complete sameness in the whole mixture.

We should have found, without doubt, more curious and circumstantial observations, in the generality of authors who have examined this plant, if they had been as fully persuaded of its utility in the arts, as of its medical properties.

Pliny tells us, that Hemp-seed is of a drying nature, that it weakens the generative powers in men,* when they eat it to excess. On the contrary, it promotes fruitfulness in fowls, for which reason it is purposely given them in winter time, and is a food to which birds are accustomed. It expels wind; is hard of digestion; and disagrees with the stomach; it produces bad humours, and occasions headachs.* It was formerly one of those legumes, which were fried for deserts.* It was also made into little sweet cakes, to be eaten at collations, and to promote drinking; but, at present, this unwholesome ragout is quite banished from our tables: It heats those that eat it too freely so much, that it occasions very dangerous vapours*; so that those who prescribe a decoction of this seed to children that labour under epilepsies, far from procuring them relief, increase and irritate their disorder. The juice of it,* squeezed out when it is green, draws insects to it, and brings out all the vermin that enter into the ears, and infest them. Taken in an emulsion,* it is good against a cough and the jaundice, and also against the gonorrhœa; its oil is recommended as an ingredient in pomatums for the small-pox; and it is laxative. Taken inwardly, or outwardly applied, it has not the dangerous qualities that are ascribed to the whole plant with its leaves; the powder of it, mixt with drink, will make those who use it drunk, dull, and stupid: We are told that the Arabians* make a sort of wine of it, which intoxicates, and poor people eat the oil of it in their soup.

The grain and the leaves being squeezed, while they are green, and applied, by way of cataplasm, to painful tumours, are reckoned to have a great power of relaxing and stupifying. The smell of it is extremely strong and intoxicating. It is pretended, that the water, in which Hemp hath been steeped, proves a deadly poison to any that drink of it: This may be true; but what is commonly said of the same danger to fishes in the rivers* and ponds, in which Hemp is watered, is false. Fishes love this plant, and fly to it; but if any accidents of this kind should happen, they can only be owing to the smallness of some reservoirs, where the water not having a free course, may be too much impregnated with the juice of the Hemp, or afford to the fish too much of a delicious food, an excess of which is aways hurtful.

What Pliny assures us, of the great effect which an infusion of Hemp may have in coagulating water,* will not appear surprizing if wie attend to the quality and quantity of the gum, which unites all the fibres of this plant together, and whereof, in reality, it intirely consists. It is, doubtless, for this reason, that it is given in drink to cattle to cure looseness. The decoction of green Hemp, with its seed, when well cleared of the dregs, causes the worms to come out of the ground on which it is poured, and the fishermen commonly make use of this expedient to catch them, when they have occasion.

*) The Ordonance of Waters and Forests on this subject seems not to be well founded.

*) _Tantaque vis ei est, ut aquæ infusæ eam coagulare dicatur, et ideo Jumentorum alvo succurrit pota in aquam._ Plin, l. 20. c. 23.

Matthiolus presumes, that it may also have power to drive worms out of the human body. It is given in a drink to cattle and horses troubled with a looseness; the whole substance of the Hemp being gummy, it is by no means surprizing that it should have a restringent quality; and this is the reason why the powder of its leaves, taken in drink, is reckoned good for dysenteries, and the dust of the Hemp itself, which the labourers draw in with their breath, when they are at work upon it, causes obstructions in their lungs, and almost always, makes them asthmatic.

The root of it* boiled in water, and applied in the form of a cataplasm, softens and restores the joints of fingers or toes that are dried and shrunk. It is very good against the gout, and other humours that fall upon the nervous, muscular, and tendinous parts. It abates inflammations, dissolves tumours and hard swellings upon the joints. Beat and pounded in a mortar, with butter, when it is still fresh, it is applied to burns, which it relieves greatly when it is often renewed. The juice and decoction of it, put into the fundaments of horses, brings out the vermin that infest them.

Even the lint* which is yielded by hempen cloth, especially that which comes from the sails of vessels, is very much esteemed in physic, and the ashes of these sails serve for Spodium, Lapis Calaminaris, or Tutty.

# Part 2. Of the Methods of cultivating, dressing, and manufacturing it, as improved by the Experience of modern Times.

After having laid before the reader, in the former Part, all that our researches could produce with respect to the Natural History of Hemp, the object that appears to us most interesting, is its Cultivation.

The ground intended the a Hemp-field, ought to be the very best that can be afforded, either near the house,* or along some stream, or water-ditch, yet so, that there is no ground to fear an inundation. To render this ground fruitful, we must not spare either manure or labour. Hemp-grounds must be dunged every year, and the better to secure success, it would be proper to lay on the dung before the winter tillage, that it may waste itself there, and mix the more perfectly with the ground, which, impregnated with these new salts, will derive the greater advantages from the influences of that season, and catch more of the volatile salts of the air, that commonly abound most in the winter.

*) _At pauper rigui custos alabandicus horti_  
_Cannabias nutrit silvas, quam commoda nostro_  
_Armamenta operi! gravis est tutela, sed ipsis_  
_Tu licet Æmonios includas retibus ursos._  
Gratian. in Cyneget. v. 46.

Of all the sorts of dung, that are used for Hemp-grounds, pigeons-dung only, or any other kind of dung that is fully ripe, ought to be laid on before the last labour; as is practised with success in several places. In countries where the land is strong they generally lay it in heaps after Autumn. In this manner it becomes more free and light, than when it is only tilled. The snow and rains, which penetrate it in the winter time, and the frosts that are common in that season, kill, if we may so express it, that ground, as they would a chalk-stone, and make it so free, that in the month of February nothing more is wanting, but to lay it level by a quick and easy labour. All its parts, and even the most tender particles, will be then found extremely small, light, and lively.

But different soils require different methods of preparation; and it is the part of men of understanding to discontinue bad customs, that have prevailed till this time, and substitute better methods in their place.

Hemp is one of those plants, which Nature has hot only made necessary, but also common, and suited to every sort of soil, as well as to every climate. It is true, that countries which are extremely hot, are not favourable to it; but as this plant is but a short time in the ground, if a country is at all habitable by men, we are of opinion they may also cultivate Hemp. Rainy seasons are proper enough for sowing it, and when it is once in condition to cover the ground, the dews alone, which are plentiful in these countries, will be sufficient to bring it to maturity. It will not, to be sure, grow so high as in temperate, or colder climates, but it may be, perhaps, on that very account, the more fit for use.

We find, by experience, that in temperate climates, _France for instance_, the Hemp cultivated in the southern provinces has better qualities than that which grows in the northern, where the ground is fat, and not so warm.

In the north of America and Europe, Hemp thrives exceeding well: that commodity is exported from thence into England, Holland, and even France, to the shame and detriment of those that cultivate it with us. Could no means be fallen upon to encourage them, and increase their number? What country is in better condition to apply to it, and profit by it, than France?* All her provinces produce very good Hemp; and, instead of taking it from strangers, we ought to put ourselves in condition to sell it to them. Guyenne, Languedoc, Provence, Dauphiny, Auvergne, Burgundy, and Berry produce as good Hemp as can be wished, and nothing is wanting but the best methods of cultivating and preparing it.

*) The Council passed some Acts in December 1719, and in May and June 1722, which it would be proper to consider.

The first, and most important operation, ought to be performed before winter. Some do it with the plough, others with the pick-axe, and others with the spade; the last of these, without doubt, is the best, because it goes deepest and makes the ground more free.* In the beginning of the spring the ground is prepared by fresh labour, for receiving the seed, in such manner, that not so much as one clod be left unbroken, and the whole field be as smooth and in as good plight as a plot in a garden.
